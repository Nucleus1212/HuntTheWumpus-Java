# HuntTheWumpus-Java
This project was developed as part of my CSC 202 coursework at Augustana College. The game uses multiple classes (Player, Cave, Wumpus) to manage game logic and movement. It reinforces OOP concepts such as encapsulation, abstraction, and control flow using loops and conditionals.
